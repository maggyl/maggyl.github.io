# Patents
I have been very fortunate to be able to collaborate with so many brilliant minds at Zenseact (and formerly Zenuity) and have come up with many exciting ideas, some of which have turned into patent applications. Below are some statistics of my contributions to the patent portfolio of Zenseact. All of my published patents can be found at [Espacenet](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search?q=magnus%20gyllenhammar).
