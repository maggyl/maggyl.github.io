# Abstract
The tables presented below provide the basis for conducting the research gap analysis for our survey paper titled: "The Road to Safe Automated Driving Systems: A Review of Methods Providing Safety Evidence". For each discussed method, the challenges (C1-C8 of Sec. III) classified as either a FC (fundamental challenge), O (obstacle) or U (unclear) (as per TABLE I in the survey paper) result in a separate row in the table below. Further, for each such row a gap is identified by consulting the discussions of sections IV through VII. Subsequently, the raw identified gaps are collected and eventual connections to similar considerations between different rows, relating to the same method as well as other methods, are given. The table below presents this intermediate step of identified gaps before they are collected into categories and formulated as proper research questions, as presented in Sec. VIII.C of the survey paper.

Notably, for operational data collection no challenge (C1-C8) has been identified as posing significant obstacles or unclarities. However, there are other short-comings of this method highlighted in Sec. VI.A that warrant considerations for using this method to provide safety evidence for the ADS.
