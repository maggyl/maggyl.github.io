# Abstract
This is a complementary document to the main paper ”The Safety Life Cycle of Automated Driving Systems and Interdependences of Development Methods”. Here the blank cells in the interconnections classifications, presented in the main paper, are motivated. The main paper thus captures the connections between the development methods, whereas this complementary document motivates the cases where the absence of a connection is indicated in TABLE I of the main paper.
